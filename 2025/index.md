# Course Structure

This course is divided into 6 steps, each building on the previous one. The steps are as follows:

0. **Command Line Interface, Linux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux**:  
   This step introduces the command line interface (CLI) and the Linux operating system. We start with the history of interaction with computers, introducing the source and the importance of CLI. We then move on to the Linux operating system, which is widely used in the server field, learning how to perform basic operations in a Linux environment. Finally, we introduce the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows you to run a Linux distribution on Windows.

1. **The Internet, HTTP and DNS**:  
   This step covers the fundamentals of computer networks and the internet. We start with a naive computer network, till the HTTP protocol, which is used to transfer data over the web, and the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates domain names into IP addresses. HTTP and DNS is the foundation of the web.

2. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**:  
   This step introduces the core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The text contains these code is the main content transferring on the web. HTML is used to define the structure of the content, CSS is used to style the content and define the layout, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the content.

3. **Node.js, TypeScript, and React**:  
   This step introduces the core components of the modern web: Node.js, TypeScript, and React. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, refining the engineering ability of JS. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces in a modern component based paradigm.

4. **Gatsby**:  
   This step introduces Gatsby, a static site generator that uses React and Node.js to build fast and efficient websites, which is perfect for building up a iGEM wiki website. You will learn how to create a personal blog using Gatsby.

5. **Git and Deployment**:  
   This step introduces Git, a version control system, and demonstrates how to deploy your website using services like GitLab Pages.
